# RoomCalendar

## Backstory
I'm working on a Medium post explaining the motivation and thought process behind this simple app

## What is this thing?
This is an asp.net web app that grabs ICal data from one or more URLs and then uses VueJS on the front-end to display a nice looking status screen for a meeting room. It's super simple.
