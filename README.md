## Backstory
Read my Medium post about this app: https://medium.com/@adamfeil/making-a-meeting-room-availability-display-a5f562714a9f

## What is this thing?
This is an asp.net web app that grabs ICal data from one or more URLs and then uses VueJS on the front-end to display a nice looking status screen for a meeting room. It's super simple.
